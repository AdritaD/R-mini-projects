#a)read file college.csv
college<-read.csv("C:/Users/adrit/Desktop/utd/sem2/stats for ds/project/PROJ2/College.csv");

#b)
#fix file, see the look of it
fix(college);

#now we set names to each row(R will not perform any operations on row names:)
#extra column for row name added for each row
rownames(college)<-college[,1];

#see the look of the table again(this time with an extra column for names)
fix(college);

#now that we have 2 columns with uni name, delete 1
#delete the original 1 as calculations can be done on that.
college<-college[,-1];

#see table again:
fix(college);


#c)
#i)summary of data set(MIN,Q1,Q2,MEAN,Q3,MAX)
summary(college);


#ii)scatterplot matrix of first 10 columns:
pairs(college[,1:10]);

#iii)side by side boxplots of Outstate vs Private
plot(college$Outstate,college$Private)
boxplot(college$Outstate,college$Private)


#iv)creating Elite(top 10 percentile)
Elite=rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc>50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(college,Elite)


#summary of Elite universities
summary(college$Elite)

#boxplots of outstate vs Elite
plot(college$Outstate,college$Elite)
boxplot(college$Outstate,college$Elite)


#v)histograms of a few variables with different bin size
#dividing display page 
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

#histogram of romm and board costs
hist(college$Room.Board)

#histogram of PhD students
hist(college$PhD, col=4, breaks = 2)

#histogram of student faculty ratio
hist(college$S.F.Ratio, breaks =100)

#histogram of top 25 percentile
hist(college$Top25perc, col=2)



#vi)doing other experiments on data:
#boxplot of no of acceptances and graduation rate
#we see here the higher the acceptance, graduation rate has lesser variance)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(college$Accept, college$Grad.Rate)
boxplot(college$Accept, college$Grad.Rate)


#boxplot of applicant no vs percentage of faculty with PHD
#more applicants if more number of faculty have phd
plot(college$PhD, college$Apps)
boxplot(college$PhD, college$Apps)


#boxplot of Enroll and Books
#more variance in costs of books when lesser students enrolled
plot(college$Enroll, college$Books)
boxplot(college$Enroll, college$Books)


#personal exp vs percentage of alumni who donate
#as personal expenses increase donations have lower variance and thus lower average values.
#if they spent less in college they are more likely to donate
plot(college$Personal, college$perc.alumni)
